3. Hi I'm from **Minsk**, for the last few years I have been working with **Lua (and less JS)** to create FiveM scripts (GTA V based online game mode) (such as Universety System, new inventory interface, car system, etc). For a year I worked at the **Bank** as a creator of new banking products. Now I realized that **I want to work in IT**, so I signed up for this course.
